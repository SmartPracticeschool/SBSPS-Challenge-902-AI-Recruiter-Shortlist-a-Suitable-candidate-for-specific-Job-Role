AI Recruiter – Shortlist A Suitable Candidate For Specific Job Role

Project Description:

52% of talent acquisition leaders say that the most difficult part of their job is to shortlist the right candidate and 3% of candidates never hear back from a company after one touchpoint. 
On the flip side, it’s a challenge for employers to communicate well with all their candidates. 
For high volume recruiting, this would require communicating with thousands of candidates, in addition to a recruiter’s normal screening functions and other duties.
Artificial Intelligence enabled software bots can definitely provide a solution for this problem.
